/**

 * - The `.shouldUpdate` lifecycle hook needs to be called. It is not
 * currently. This should be a lifecycle hook that behaves like ReactJS today.
 *  - Later we can make a better one using the same single factory function.
 * - componentWillReceiveProps but allowing side effects (Alternatively,
 * justify why we believe this is not needed - perhaps didUpdate is
 * sufficient).
 * - componentDidMount functionality (or perhaps we won't implement it). At
 * least decide that we won't support it and justify our decision.
 * ------------Cutoff to replace the V1 bindings with V2 ----------------------
 * - A way to invoke pure functions with JSX which don't have controllers.
 * - A more fine grained shouldComponentUpdate. Returning portions of previous
 * subelements from last `create`.
 */

/**
 * TODO: Test Cases (Highest Priority First):
 * -------------------
 * 1. That a silent update will not block received props!
 * 2. That a silent update will not block another state update! (Two different
 * DOM nodes having event handlers - one triggering silent, the other
 * triggering loud). Then switch which one is invoked first.
 * 3. Add tests for "handle()". (non state updating callback)
 * ------------Cutoff to replace the V1 bindings with V2 ----------------------
 * 4. Multiple setStates on didMount.
 *   - A deep nested component and higher-in-tree component both updating states.
 *     - Does the state change of the higher one flush down to the lower one
 *       and therefore effect the lower one's props in its didMount?
 *       - Perhaps it shouldn't. Maybe we can't make that even happen.
 * 5. updating only a portion of components.
 */
/* TODOs below this point don't need to block the migration / switch to v2. They need to
 * be done before releasing widely and encouraging other devs to use v2. */

/**
 * TODO: Document:
 * --------------
 * Document the component and tooling abstractions that the core API eliminates
 * most of the time.
 *
 * - getInitialState.
 * - Polymorphic props.
 * - shouldComponentUpdate.
 * - willReceiveProps.
 * - getDefaultProps.
 * - propTypes.
 * - Instance variables.
 * - Some portion of unit tests.
 * - Reduces two forms of state setting to one.
 * - Kills constructor and willMount.
 * - Demonstrate that we can also implement this API via a simple `include
 *   ReactComponent.Create {}`
 *
 * Philosophy:
 * -----------
 * - Create a more formal description of the Reason React API.
 * - Document benefits of the ability to have plain integers/strings as state types.
