# Reason React Website
This code is used to generate [https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react). It uses [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) to pull in files from `../docs` and this directory to generate static html files.

## Translations
The entire site can be translated via the [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/reason-react). This repo only has the canonical english documentation. If you add new strings to this directory, please run `yarn write-translations`/`npm run write-translations`.

## Building and Deploying
*TODO*
This build requires an unreleased version of Docusaurus. Once that is up we will fully document the process. Until then, reach out to @rickyvetter for building/deploying the site.
