# Reason React

ReasonReact is a safer, simpler way to build React components in [Reason](http://facebook.github.io/reason/).

It integrates deeply with language level features in order to create an expressive, statically typed API, packed into a tiny API surface area.

By binding directly to ReactJS, ReasonReact gives you access to the entire React ecosystem, so that you can adopt it incrementally.

_This documentation assumes relative familiarity with ReactJS._

## Intro Examples

```reason
let component = ReasonReact.statefulComponent "Greeting";

/* underscore before names indicate unused variables. We name them for clarity */
let make ::name _children => {
  let click _event state _self => ReasonReact.Update (state + 1);
  {
    ...component,
    initialState: fun () => 0,
    render: fun state self => {
      let greeting = "Hello " ^ name ^ ". You've clicked the button " ^ (string_of_int state) ^ " time(s)!";
      <button onClick=(self.update click)> (ReasonReact.stringToElement greeting) </button>
    }
  }
};
```

## JSX

Reason comes with the [JSX](http://facebook.github.io/reason/#diving-deeper-jsx) syntax! ReasonReact transforms it from an agnostic function call into a library-specific call though a macro. To take advantage of ReasonReact JSX, put `{"reason": {"react-jsx": 2}"` in your [`bsconfig.json`](http://bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/Manual.html#_bucklescript_build_system_code_bsb_code) (schema [here](http://bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/docson/#build-schema.json)).

**Note** that due to current syntax constraints, you need to put spaces around the JSX children: `<div> foo </div>`.

### Uncapitalized

```reason
<div foo=bar> child1 child2 </div>
```

transforms into

```reason
ReactDOMRe.createElement "div" props::(ReactDOMRe.props foo::bar ()) [|child1, child2|]
```

which compiles to the JS code `React.createElement('div', {foo: bar}, child1, child2)`.

Prop-less `<div />` transforms to `ReactDOMRe.createElement "div" [|child1, child2|]`, which compiles to `React.createElement('div', undefined, child1, child2)`.

### Capitalized

```reason
<MyReasonComponent key=a ref=b foo=bar> child1 child2 </MyReasonComponent>
```

transforms to

```reason
ReasonReact.element key::a ref::b (MyReasonComponent.make foo::bar [|child1, child2|])
```

Prop-less `<MyReasonComponent />` transforms to `ReasonReact.element (MyReasonComponent.make [||])`.

## Component Creation

A component template is created through `ReasonReact.statelessComponent "ComponentName"`. The string being passed is for debugging purposes (the equivalent of ReactJS' [`displayName`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-component.html#displayname)).

As an example, here's a `greeting.re` file's content:

```reason
let component = ReasonReact.statelessComponent "Greeting";
```

Now we'll define the function that's called when other files invoke `<Greeting name="John" />` (without JSX: `ReasonReact.element (Greeting.make name::"John" [||])`): the `make` function. It must return the component spec template we just defined, with functions such as `render` overridden:

```reason
let component = ReasonReact.statelessComponent "Greeting";
let make ::name _children => {
  ...component, /* spread the template's other defaults into here  */
  render: fun () _self => <div> (ReasonReact.stringToElement name) </div>
};
```

**Note**: place `make` and `component` right beside each other! This helps readability and avoiding a corner-case type error for `state`.

### State

To turn a component stateful, use `ReasonReact.statefulComponent "ComponentName"` instead. Then, provide the `initialState` method. The state type you return **can be anything**!

```reason
let component = ReasonReact.statefulComponent "Greeting";
let make ::name _children => {
  ...component,
  initialState: fun () => 0, /* here, state is an `int` */
  render: fun state self => {
    let greeting = "Hello " ^ name ^ ". You've clicked the button " ^ (string_of_int state) ^ " time(s)!";
    <div> (ReasonReact.stringToElement greeting) </div>
  }
};
```

_As a matter of fact, `ReasonReact.statelessComponent` is just a convenience helper of `statefulComponent`, with the `state` type being pre-set to `()` (called "unit")_.

### Props

Props are just the labeled arguments of the `make` function, seen above. They can also be optional and/or have defaults, e.g. `let make ::name ::age=? ::className="box" _children => ...`.

The last prop **must** be `children`. If you don't use it, simply ignore it by naming it `_` or `_children`. Names starting with underscore don't trigger compiler warnings if they're unused.

### Render

`render` needs to return a `ReasonReact.reactElement`: `<div />`, `<MyComponent />`, `ReasonReact.nullElement` (the `null` you'd usually return, but this time of the `reactElement` type), etc. It takes in `state` (which is `()` for stateless components) and `self`, described below.

### `self`

`self` is a record that contains `update` and `handle`, used in conjunctions with callbacks props passed to components.

### Callback Handlers

In ReactJS, we can do `<div onClick={this.handleClick} />` and in `handleClick`, access the latest `props` and `state` (despite the callback being asynchronous) through `this.props` and `this.state`. We don't use `this` in ReasonReact; to access the newest `props`, simply put the callbacks in `make`'s body and read its arguments. To access the newest `state`, wrap the callback with `self.update`!

```reason
let component = ...;
let make ::name _children => {
  let click _event state _self => ReasonReact.Update (state + 1); /* this state is guaranteed fresh */
  {
    ...component,
    initialState: ...,
    render: fun state self => {
      let greeting = ...;
      <button onClick=(self.update click)> (ReasonReact.stringToElement greeting) </button>
    }
  }
};
```

`update` expects a callback that:

- Accepts a payload, the newest state and `self`.
- Returns a `ReasonReact.update 'state`, aka either:
  - `ReasonReact.Update newStateToBeSet`: indicates the handler (e.g. `click`) wants to update the state (in ReactJS, it'd be an imperative `setState` call).
  - `ReasonReact.NoUpdate`: no state update.
  - `ReasonReact.SilentUpdate newStateToBeSet`: like `ReasonReact.Update`, but without triggering a re-render. Useful for `ref` and other instance variables, described later.

and `update` itself returns a function, the actual, ordinary callback passed to the component as prop. When the callback's invoked, `update` will in turn invoke the originally passed in handler, forwarding the payload, the up-to-date state, and `self`.

Often times, you'd return `NoUpdate` from the handler. For convenience, we've exposed a `self.handle`, which is just an `update` that doesn't expect a return value (aka expects just `unit`).

**Note**: sometimes you might be forwarding `update` or `handle` to some helpers. Pass the whole `self` instead and **annotate it**. This avoids a complex `self` record type behavior. See [Common Type Errors](#reason-react-common-type-errors). Example:

```reason
let click event state self => ...;

let renderItem self => {
  /* this needs to be self.ReasonReact.update, not self.update */
  <div onClick=(self.ReasonReact.update click)>
};

let make ::name _children => {
  ...component,
  render: fun state self => {
    let item = renderItem self;
    ...
  }
}
```

### Lifecycle Events

ReasonReact supports the usuals:

```reason
willReceiveProps: state => self => state,
didMount: state => self => update state,
didUpdate: previousState::state => currentState::state => self => unit,
willUnmount: state => self => unit,
willUpdate: previousState::state => nextState::state => self => unit,
```

Note:

- We've dropped the `component` prefix from all these.
- `willReceiveProps` asks, for the return type, to be `state`, not `update state` (i.e. `NoUpdate/Update/SilentUpdate`). We presume you'd always want to update the state in this lifecycle. If not, simply return the previous `state` exposed in the lifecycle argument.
- `didUpdate`, `willUnmount` and `willUpdate` don't allow you to return a new state to be updated, to prevent infinite loops.
- `didUpdate` and `willUpdate` are labeled now! This reduces confusion.
- `willMount` is unsupported. Use `didMount` instead.

**There's a catch**. Some new lifecyle methods act differently. Described below.

### Access next or previous props

One pattern that's sometimes used in ReactJS is accessing a lifecyle event's `prevProps` (`componentDidUpdate`), `nextProps` (`componentWillUpdate`), and so on. ReasonReact doesn't automatically keep copies of previous/next props/state for you yet. The next sections provide the solutions.

#### `willReceiveProps`

Traditional ReactJS `componentWillReceiveProps` takes in a `nextProps`. We don't have `nextProps`, since those are simply the labeled arguments in `make`, available to you in the scope. To access the _current_ props, however, you'd need to manually copy those props into state, and access them from state:

```reason
type state = {
  someToggle: bool,
  /* copied over from props */
  name: string
};

let component = ...;
let make ::name _children => {
  ...component,
  initialState: fun () => {someToggle: false, name},
  willReceiveProps: fun state self => {
    if (state.name === name) {
      ...
      /* previous ReactJS logic would be: if (props.name === nextProps.name)
    }
    /* don't forget to sync props into state */
    {...state, name}
  }
}
```

**Don't forget this props-to-state forwarding**! This is the one place you need to it do. If you forget, you might not get the freshest data.

Compared to the ReactJS approach, this method is more manual and slightly error-prone, though it has the advantage of only retaining the props that are needed and other rather nuanced benefits. We're working on making this API smoother.

#### `willUpdate`

(**Assuming you've synced parts of the props into state in `willReceiveProps`**) ReactJS' `componentwillUpdate`'s `nextProps` is just the labeled arguments in `make`, and "current props" (aka `this.props`) is the props you've copied into state, accessible via ReasonReact's `previousState`.

#### `didUpdate`

ReactJS' `prevProps` is what you've synced in state, under `previousState`.

### Instance Variables

A common pattern in ReactJS is to attach extra variables onto a component's spec:

```
const Greeting = React.createClass({
  intervalId: null,
  componentDidMount: () => this.intervalId = setInterval(...),
  render: ...
});
```

In reality, this is nothing but a thinly veiled way to mutate a component's "state", without triggering a re-render. ReasonReact asks you to correctly put these instance variables into your component's `state`. To simulate updating the references without triggering a re-render, use `SilentUpdate`:

```reason
type state = {intervalId: option int, someOtherVar: option string};
let component = ...; /* remember, `component` needs to be close to `make`, and after `state` type declaration! */
let make _children => {
  ...component,
  initialState: fun () => {intervalId: None, someOtherVar: Some "hello"},
  didMount: fun state _self => ReasonReact.SilentUpdate {...state, intervalId: Some (setInterval ...)},
  render: ...
};
```

### Ref

A `ref` would be just another instance variable. You'd type it as `ReasonReact.reactRef` if it's attached to a custom component, and `Dom.element` if it's attached to a React DOM element.

```reason
type state = {isOpen: bool, mySectionRef: option ReasonReact.reactRef};

let setSectionRef theRef state _self => ReasonReact.SilentUpdate {...state, mySectionRef: Some theRef};

let component = ReasonReact.statefulComponent "MyPanel";
let make ::className="" _children => {
  ...component,
  initialState: fun () => {isOpen: false, mySectionRef: None},
  render: fun state self => <Section1 ref=(self.update setSectionRef) />
};
```

Attaching to a React DOM element looks the same: `ReasonReact.SilentUpdate {...state, myDivRef: Js.Null.to_opt theRef}`. **Note** how [React DOM refs can be null](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9328#issuecomment-298438237). Which is why `myDivRef` is converted from a [JS nullable](http://bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/Manual.html#_null_and_undefined) to an OCaml `option` (Some/None).

ReasonReact ref only accept callbacks. The string `ref` from ReactJS is deprecated.

We also expose an escape hatch `ReasonReact.refToJsObj` (type: `ReasonReact.reactRef => Js.t {..}`) which turns your ref into a JS object you can freely use; **this is only used to access ReactJS component class methods**.

```reason
let handleClick event state self =>
  switch state.mySectionRef {
  | None => ()
  | Some r => (ReasonReact.refToJsObj r)##someMethod 1 2 3 /* I solemnly swear that I am up to no good */
  };
```

## React Element

What if you want to return `null` from a `render`? Or pass an array as children? Or a string?

In ReactJS, you can easily do: `<div> hello </div>`, `<div> 1 </div>`, `<div> null </div>`, etc. In Reason, the type system restrict you from passing arbitrary data like so. Fortunately, we special-case a few special elements of the type `ReasonReact.reactElement`:

- `ReasonReact.nullElement`: this is your `null`.
- `ReasonReact.stringToElement foo`: this takes a string and casts it to `reactElement`. You'd use `<div> (ReasonReact.stringToElement (string_of_int 10)) </div>` to display an int.
- `ReasonReact.arrayToElement foo`: takes an array and casts it to `reactElement`.

## Interop With Existing JavaScript Components

### ReasonReact using ReactJS

Easy! Since other Reason components only need you to expose a `make` function, fake one up:

```reason
external myJSReactClass : ReasonReact.reactClass = "myJSReactClass" [@@bs.module];

let make name::(name: string) age::(age: option int)=? children =>
  ReasonReact.wrapJsForReason
    reactClass::myJSReactClass
    props::{"name": name, "age": Js.Null_undefined.from_opt age}
    children;
```

`ReasonReact.wrapJsForReason` is the helper we expose for this purpose. It takes in the `reactClass` you want to wrap, the `props` js object (of type `Js.t {. foo: bar}`) you'd pass to it (with values converted from Reason data structures to JS), and the mandatory children you'd forward to the JS side.

**We recommend** to type the `make` parameters, since they're passed to `props` into the JS side, which is untyped.

### ReactJS Using ReasonReact

Eeeeasy. We expose a helper for the other direction, `ReasonReact.wrapReasonForJs`:

```reason
let component = ...;
let make ...;

let comp =
  ReasonReact.wrapReasonForJs
    ::component
    (fun jsProps => make name::jsProps##name age::?(Js.Null_undefined.to_opt jsProps##age) [||]);
```

The function takes in the labeled reason `component` you've created, and a function that, given the js props, asks you to call `make` while passing in the correctly converted parameters. You'd assign the whole thing to something like `comp`. The JS side can then import it:

```
var MyReasonComponent = require('myReasonComponent').comp;
// make sure you're passing the correct data types!
<MyReasonComponent name="John" />
```

## Events

ReasonReact events map cleanly to ReactJS [synthetic events](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/events.html). More info in the [inline docs](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react/blob/380358e5894d4223e7dd9c1fb2df72f0756231bc/src/reactEventRe.rei#L1).

If you're accessing fields on your event object, like `event.target.value`, see [Working with DOM](#reason-react-working-with-dom) below.

## Styles

Since CSS-in-JS is all the rage right now, we'll recommend our official pick soon. In the meantime, for inline styles, there's the `ReactDOMRe.Style.make` API:

```reason
<div style=(
  ReactDOMRe.Style.make
    color::"#444444"
    fontSize::"68px"
    ()
)/>
```

It's a labeled (typed!) function call that maps to the familiar style object `{color: '#444444', fontSize: '68px'}`. **Note** that `make` returns an opaque `ReactDOMRe.style` type that you can't read into. We also expose a `ReactDOMRe.Style.combine` that takes in two `style`s and combine them.

## Working with DOM

The `ReactDOMRe` module below exposes an unsafe `domElementToObj`. That's all you need.

### ReactDOM

ReasonReact's equivalent `ReactDOMRe` exposes:

- `render : ReasonReact.reactElement => Dom.element => unit`

- `unmountComponentAtNode : Dom.element => unit`

- `findDOMNode : ReasonReact.reactRef => Dom.element`

- `objToDOMProps : Js.t {..} => reactDOMProps` (see use-case in [Invalid Prop Name](#reason-react-convert-over-reactjs-idioms-invalid-prop-name))

And two helpers:

- `domElementToObj : Dom.element => Js.t {..}`: turns a DOM element into a Js object whose fields that you can dangerously access: `(ReactDOMRe.domElementToObj (ReactEventRe.Form.target event))##value`.

- `renderToElementWithClassName : ReasonReact.reactElement => string => unit`: convenience. Finds the (first) element of the provided class name and `render` to it.

- `renderToElementWithId : ReasonReact.reactElement => string => unit`: convenience. Finds the element of the provided id and `render` to it.

### ReactDOMServer

ReasonReact's equivalent `ReactDOMServerRe` exposes:

- `renderToString : ReactRe.reactElement => string`

- `renderToStaticMarkup : ReactRe.reactElement => string`

## Convert Over ReactJS Idioms

### Pass in Components Class as a Prop

In ReactJS, `<Menu banner=MyBanner />` is easy; in ReasonReact, we can't trivially pass the whole component module ([explanations](http://facebook.github.io/reason/modules.html#modules-basic-modules)). Solution:

```reason
let bannerCallback prop1 prop2 => <MyBanner message=prop1 count=prop2 />;
<Menu bannerFunc=bannerCallback />
```

**Due to an existing bug in our transform right now, you can't inline that call**. This will be fixed soon. Sorry!

### Invalid Prop Name

Prop names like `type` (as in `<input type="text" />`) aren't syntactically valid; `type` is a reserved keyword in Reason/OCaml. Use `<input _type="text" />` instead. This follows BuckleScript's [name mangling rules](http://bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/Manual.html#_object_label_translation_convention).

For `data-*` and `aria-*`, this is a bit trickier; You'd currently need to resort to using `ReactDOMRe.objToDOMProps` + the underlying desugared JSX call:

```reason
ReactDOMRe.createElement
  "li"
  props::(ReactDOMRe.objToDOMProps {"className": "foo", "aria-selected": true})
  [|child1, child2|]
```

For non-DOM components, you'd need to expose valid prop names.

## Miscellaneous

- ReasonReact doesn't support ReactJS context (yet).
- No mixins.

## Common Type Errors

#### The type constructor state would escape its scope

This probably means you've defined your `state` type _after_ `let component = ...`. Move it before the `let`.

It could also mean that you've defined a `statefulComponent` but haven't started using its state yet; The error message here isn't great. It should be "don't forget to use state at least once!". We'll improve the errors soon.

#### Unbound record field update/Unbound record field handle

This means you've passed `self` to a helper function of your render, and it used it like so: `<div onClick=(self.update click)/>`. This is because the record can't be found in the scope of the file. Just annotate it: `<div onClick=(self.ReasonReact.update click)/>`.

#### Something about callbacks passed to `update` (or `handle`) having incompatible types between them

You've probably passed `self.update` to a helper function that uses this `update` reference twice. For complex reasons this doesn't type; you'd have to pass in the whole `self` to the helper.
