ReasonReact is a safer, simpler way to build React components in [Reason](http://reasonml.github.io/).

It integrates deeply with language level features in order to create an expressive, statically typed API, packed into a tiny API surface area.

By binding directly to ReactJS, ReasonReact gives you access to the entire React ecosystem, so that you can adopt it incrementally.

_This documentation assumes relative familiarity with ReactJS._
